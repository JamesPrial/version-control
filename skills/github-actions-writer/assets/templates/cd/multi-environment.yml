# Configuration notes:
#
# Environment setup in GitHub:
# 1. Go to Settings → Environments
# 2. Create environments: development, staging, production
# 3. For production:
#    - Add required reviewers
#    - Set wait timer (optional)
#    - Restrict to protected branches
#
# Required secrets:
# - AWS_ROLE_ARN_DEV: IAM role for development
# - AWS_ROLE_ARN_STAGING: IAM role for staging
# - AWS_ROLE_ARN_PROD: IAM role for production
# - SLACK_WEBHOOK: Slack webhook URL for notifications
#
# Deployment strategy:
# - Development: Automatic from develop branch
# - Staging: Automatic from main branch
# - Production: Requires approval + tests pass
#
# Features:
# 1. Automated testing at each stage
# 2. Manual approval gates for production
# 3. Smoke tests after deployment
# 4. Performance and security testing
# 5. Rollback capability
# 6. Deployment notifications
# 7. Blue-green deployment support
#
# Customization tips:
# 1. Adjust environment triggers based on your branching strategy
# 2. Add/remove test stages based on requirements
# 3. Implement canary or blue-green deployment
# 4. Add database migration steps
# 5. Configure monitoring and alerting
# 6. Set up automatic rollback on errors
